Notes:
- SS withdraw amount could be assumed, or calculated
  - Should also have an override for if SS is assumed at all upon retirement
- Need to make rent more dynamic (start, stop, multiple)
- Need to make car payment more dynamic (start, stop, multiple occurances)
- Have it do an assumed savings increase per month as a flat amount, or a percent
  - Allow it to have a variable increase per time period (month, year, quarter, etc)
Implementation
- I think I want to have modules that can be mixed at matched
- You create base data
	- Age yrs
	- Age months
	- Month
	- Count
- Then pass in this base data to whatever module you want to investigate
- You would also be able to create a loop to run everything any number of times and create new instances of that data
  - So maybe a class then?

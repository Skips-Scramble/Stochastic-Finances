Notes:
- months represent status at the beginning of the month
- SS withdraw amount could be assumed, or calculated
  - Should also have an override for if SS is assumed at all upon retirement
- Need to make rent more dynamic (start, stop, multiple)
- Need to make car payment more dynamic (start, stop, multiple occurances)
- Have it do an assumed savings increase per month as a flat amount, or a percent
  - Allow it to have a variable increase per time period (month, year, quarter, etc)
- Can you withdraw SS beginning at any age/month combo?
- Are interest rates (risk-free and S&P) normally distributed? or Uniform? or What?
  - Maybe normal with an unusual standard deviation?
- Need to maybe allow non-variable fields upon request (i.e. don't vary interst, or don't vary savings added per month)
